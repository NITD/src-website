SOCIAL REFORMATION CELL

The Social Reformation Cell, established in 2014 is a voluntary organization with a vision to revive the conditions of the residents of the nearby villages. The club has adopted four villages, namely, Bakoli, Bankner, and two others to which it sends its volunteers to give free tuitions to the children of these villages and also donates books and clothes to them. In addition to this, the club has organized a blood donation camp in which it collected 110 units of blood. As pledged by the club to work towards the betterment of the environment, it organized a green fest “Greening the Blue” which included a tree plantation drive in order to create awareness amongst students regarding various environmental issues and help them understand the importance of preserving trees.
